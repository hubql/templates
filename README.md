# Hubql templates
Templates for boilerplates and example data models and API schemas in JSON, Prisma, GraphQL and Protobuf

The templates are being published on Hubql as templates to get started.

Current format is a folder for each file extension, a folder for the template name and each template to provide a file and image.

### Example:
#### Blank GraphQL template
/graphql/blank/blank.graphql

/graphql/blank/blank.png


Will be rendered in Hubql template list like so:

## Contribution

To contribute you can create a PR to suggest a change to existing templates or add additional ones.

As we merge PRs to main branch they become available in Hubql.
